                <h3>Selfless Self - Talks with Sri Ramakant Maharaj: Polish Translation (scheduled for 2025)</h3>
                <p class="book-author">Author: Sri Ramakant Maharaj / English original edited by Ann Shaw</p>
                <div class="book-description">
                <p>A translation of the priceless teachings from a Master of the Navnath Sampradaya tradition</p>
                <p>Immerse yourself in the profound wisdom of one of the last true Masters of non-duality. “Selfless Self” is an extraordinary collection of conversations with Sri Ramakant Maharaj, a direct disciple to the renowned Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, conveying the essence of the timeless teachings of the Navnath Sampradaya tradition.</p>
                <p>This unique book guides readers through the fundamental questions of human existence - Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the nature of reality? - offering deep, transformative answers that transcend intellectual concepts.</p>
                <p>Sri Ramakant Maharaj, like his predecessors in the lineage of Masters including Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and Siddharameshwar Maharaj, points to the direct path to recognising one's true nature, beyond all limitations.</p>
                <p>The original English text was edited by Ann Shaw, while the Polish translation has been prepared by another disciple of Sri Ramakant Maharaj; both were initiated into the Nath tradition, seeking only to faithfully convey the depth and power of their beloved Master's teachings.</p>
                <p>For those seeking authentic spiritual wisdom, this book serves as an invaluable guide leading to the discovery of that which has always been present - the unlimited, unchanging reality beyond all concepts, time and space.</p>

                <h3>Bagua Chun Gen Qigong: A System for Health, Grounding, and Renewal (scheduled for 2025)</h3>
                <div class="book-description"><p>This practical guide presents Bagua Chun Gen Qigong, a very rarely taught and never before documented Qigong form designed to promote physical wellbeing and energy cultivation. Though deceptively dissimilar to typical health exercise practices, this versatile form of Qigong offers remarkably effective benefits across multiple dimensions of wellbeing.</p>
                <p>The deliberate practices introduced in this work provide a clear pathway from fundamental techniques to more nuanced practices, making this art accessible to practitioners at all levels while preserving its authentic essence. Each exercise is presented with detailed instructions, common corrections, and progressive levels of practice to accommodate both beginners and experienced practitioners.</p>
                <p>Drawing from training across multiple traditions, the author shares insights gained through immersive study in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, and Thailand. This experience is complemented by over two decades of Yoga practice learned from teachers in Japan and India, Yoga teaching certification obtained through IYF Asia in South Korea, as well as certification as a Therapeutic Thai bodywork therapist through TTMA Japan.</p>
                <p>Having taught this system in Tokyo (2019-2020) and Vienna (2021-2022), and currently teaching in Seoul, the author presents these methods with practical applications for daily wellness. The system makes it particularly valuable for those navigating the challenges of contemporary life while seeking balance through traditional movement practices that deliver tangible results.</p></div>

                <h3>Nearer Than Your Next Thought: The Presence That Burns Lifetimes (scheduled for 2026)</h3>
                <div class="book-description"><p>This spiritual memoir and contemplative exploration introduces readers to the living wisdom of the ancient Navnath Sampradaya tradition. Following formal initiation from Sri Ramakant Maharaj, the author shares perspectives from within this sacred lineage that flows through Matsyendranath, Gorakhnath, Siddharameshwar Maharaj, Nisargadatta Maharaj, Ramakant Maharaj and other teachers of this tradition.</p>
                <p>Rather than focusing on philosophy or abstract concepts, this work invites readers into the practice of Self-inquiry through the direct pointers that have characterised this lineage for centuries. The author's journey from seeking to understanding reveals how profound truths reside not in distant spiritual realms but in immediate present awareness.</p>
                <p>Drawing from experience within this tradition, the book offers a contemporary perspective on these timeless teachings. The pages convey the essence that has guided sincere students within this lineage across generations.</p>
                <p>This work emphasises direct recognition rather than gradual practice, reflecting the Navnath approach that addresses the mind's tendency to transform teachings into mere concepts. The book is intended for spiritual students who seek understanding beyond techniques and incremental approaches, offering both examination and invitation to recognise what remains consistently present.</p>
                <p>The exploration moves not from one place to another, but from misunderstanding toward recognition - a process of acknowledging what has always been available.</p></div>

        <p>A carefully selected collection of titles from the emerging catalog of BrahmaVidya Publishing</p>



        <div class="about-detailed-text">
            <h3>About the Name: BrahmaVidya Publishing</h3>
            <p>The name “BrahmaVidya Publishing” reflects a commitment to wisdom that transcends conventional understanding. “Brahma Vidya” translates as “knowledge of the Ultimate Reality” and denotes profound insight extending beyond conceptual limitations.</p>
            <p>This term appears in diverse spiritual traditions, yet Brahma Vidya fundamentally points to universal wisdom that transcends any single religion, mythology, or belief system. The focus is on the direct exploration of consciousness and being – an inquiry accessible to all, regardless of background.</p>
            <p>The current catalog centers on works that illuminate this essential understanding of Ultimate Reality. Complementary texts on practices supporting holistic wellbeing, such as Qigong, are also included. These additional offerings provide practical methods that, while not directly addressing Ultimate Reality, offer valuable approaches to physical and energetic harmony and may serve as supportive practices for many seekers.</p>
            <p>Future publications may include works on Yoga and related disciplines that likewise contribute to integrated wellbeing and self-understanding. These contemplative practices, while distinct from direct inquiry into Ultimate Reality, provide valuable complements to the core focus of the catalog.</p>
            <p>The central mission is to make timeless wisdom accessible without confining it within the limitations of any particular religious framework, while acknowledging the diverse paths and practices that may contribute to human flourishing and understanding.</p>
